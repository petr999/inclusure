       Inclusure - Remove FreeBSD package/moduless same as those included in
       perl package itself.

VVEERRSSIIOONN
       This documentation refers to Inclusure version 0.0.1.

       The best and the first thing to remember is: till you do not pass the
       -f key to the Inclusure it will not harm anything.

       To know out how much is your problem run:

           perl inclosure.pl

       This will show you what package(s) Inclusure is about to _p_k_g___d_e_l_e_t_e(1).
       It shouldn't output the perl package itself here.

           perl inclusure.pl -d

       This will show you the duplicates for those modules already found in
       your installed Perl package.  The only exclusion is the
       "BSDPAN/ExtUtils/*" files as perl package currently installs more than
       one copy of those modules. If however there are other files on the
       standard error output this may sound as a reason to delete the certain
       package(s).

       To perform the real action(s) do:

           perl inclusure.pl -f

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
           -h  show built-in commands help
           -d  show debug information including dupe files found, non-dupe files  to
               be deleted with the packages and dupe files not related to any package
           -f  Perform the package(s) deletion(s)

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       As long as more and more modules are being included in every upcoming
       Perl core distribution the more of them are getting duplicated in a
       FreeBSD system because typically all of them are needed package(s)
       formerly installed from the corresponding ports or via BSDPAN for the
       previous Perl packages installed earlier those did not contain them
       yet.

       This may lead to errors those are not that easy to discover, e. g.,
       having different XS modules on the system is not necessarily to warn
       you about different XS part of the module loaded for the same
       particular perl module when you use it.

       Inclusure is a script  to prevent such a situation(s) by mean of
       finding the modules files on the other @INC elements than the
       directories that Perl treats as its own: that means the dupes. Then
       Inclusure tries to delete the packages that installed them if "-f"
       command line key is supplied, or prints them on the standard output if
       you need to make anything different with them otherwise.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       Warnings use to be generated when "-d" command line argument is
       supplied:

           "Dupe found: <file name>"

       - name of the file considered to be as dupe

           "File is not from packages: <file name>"

       - file name which is a dupe but does not belong to any package.

           "Dupes found in <package name> package itself:"
           <file name> ...

       - file name(s) found in the what Inclusure believes to be a Perl
       package

           "Additionally file to be deleted by pkg_delete(1) of <package name>:
           <file name>"

       - file name(s) to be deleted while not being a dupes. Those are
       typically a module build helpers and "man" files but can be of any
       kind.

       You can tweak the $dirext variable on your own opinion on location of
       files the duplicate(s) of which can be searched, and the extension(s)
       or the whole regexp to correspond to them.

       If you use a 'site customise' feature of Perl and custom-make your @INC
       then the behavior of Inclusure will depend on those changes.

       Be sure to have a consistent packages database on your "FreeBSD" system
       and a "perl-after-upgrade -f" to transfer all your modules to the new
       directories after upgrade before to use Inclusure.

       File::Find is a part of a core Perl distribution.

       FreeBSD::Pkgs is a module that works with package database of "FreeBSD"
       operating system.  Available via the "sysutils/p5-FreeBSD-Pkgs" port.

       The packages are used to be deleted despite of their dependencies. This
       may break perl and perl-dependent applications present on your system.

BBUUGGSS AANNDD LLIIMMIITTAATTIIOONNSS
       The Perl package is assumed to be the perl-<number> or
       perl-threaded-<number>. Any other kind of perl package is about to be
       deleted despite of dependencies by now.

       You should fix the dependencies on deleted modules yourself, I'd
       suggest "pkgdb -F" tool from "sysutils/portupgrade" port for this.

       This script do not fix the duplicate modules installed with bypassing
       the FreeBSD packages system.

       The modules installed with the core Perl distribution can have
       different files set and functionality and that difference may cause
       inconsistences in your existing application(s).

       Please report problems to Peter Vereshagin <peter@vereshagin.org>.
       Patches are welcome.
